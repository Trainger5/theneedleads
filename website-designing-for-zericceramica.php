                            <h2>Case Study: Website Recovery and Redesign for Zeric Ceramica </h2>
                            <h5>Client Overview</h5>
                            <p class="mb-0"><b>Client Name: </b>Zeric Ceramica</p>
                            <p class="mb-0"><b>Industry: </b>Ceramic Tiles and Sanitaryware</p>
                            <p class="mb-0"><b>Services Provided: </b>Manufacturing and selling high-quality ceramic
                                products for residential and commercial use.</p>
                            <p>Zeric Ceramica approached us with a serious issue: their product pages had been deleted
                                due to technical errors, and they had no backup database to restore the content. The
                                client also had limited access to critical information about their domain and hosting
                                provider, creating additional challenges. Our objective was to recover their lost pages,
                                resolve technical issues, and enhance the website’s functionality and user experience.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Project Objective</h5>
                            <p>WedPro Photography required a website that could showcase their portfolio in an
                                aesthetically pleasing manner while also being easy to navigate and optimized for
                                mobile. Their goal was to attract more potential clients and improve their online
                                presence by having a visually striking, functional website that reflected the quality of
                                their work. They needed a user-friendly site that would allow potential clients to
                                easily view services, access portfolios, and initiate inquiries.</p>
                            <h5>Challenges</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Product Page Loss: The client’s primary concern was the loss of critical product
                                    pages, which impacted sales and user engagement. Without a database or backup,
                                    reconstructing these pages required a meticulous, data-driven approach.</li>
                                <li>Limited Access to Hosting and Domain Details: The client lacked essential
                                    information about their domain and hosting provider, which required extensive
                                    troubleshooting and time to secure access and manage the technical aspects of the
                                    website.</li>
                                <li>Technical Errors: The website had multiple underlying technical issues that affected
                                    its functionality and user experience.</li>
                                <li>Time Constraints: Given the importance of these product pages for business
                                    operations, restoring and optimizing the website became a time-sensitive project
                                    that required a dedicated team effort.</li>
                            </ul>


                            <h5>Solution Approach</h5>
                            <p class="mb-0"><b>Domain and Hosting Access Resolution:</b></p>
                            <p>Our team conducted extensive investigations to trace the hosting provider and domain
                                registrar. We coordinated with the client and other stakeholders to gain necessary
                                access, ensuring the website could be managed and updated effectively going forward.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0"><b>Page Recovery and Reconstruction:</b></p>
                            <p class="mb-0">Using our expertise in web development, we reconstructed the deleted product
                                pages. Since there was no database backup, we gathered product details directly from the
                                client and any available online resources to accurately restore content.</p>
                            <p>We implemented data organization techniques to ensure future ease of access and recovery,
                                setting up a backup system for the website to prevent future data loss.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0"><b>Technical Optimization:</b></p>
                            <p class="mb=0">Our team performed a full technical audit of the website to identify and
                                resolve underlying issues. We addressed broken links, improved page load speed,
                                optimized the site for mobile, and fixed bugs to ensure a seamless user experience.</p>
                            <p>To prevent similar issues in the future, we implemented regular maintenance protocols and
                                provided the client with guidelines on managing the site effectively.</p>
                            <p class="mb=0"><b>Enhanced User Experience and Design:</b></p>
                            <p>After restoring the website’s functionality, we enhanced its overall look and feel,
                                making it more visually appealing and user-friendly. We optimized the layout to better
                                showcase products and improve navigation, ensuring that visitors could easily find
                                information on all devices.</p>
